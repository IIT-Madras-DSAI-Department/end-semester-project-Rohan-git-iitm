# IIT-Madras-DA2401-Machine-Learning-Lab-End-Semester-Project

## 📌 Purpose of this Template

This repository is the **starter** for your End Semester Project submission in GitHub Classroom. You can implement your solution and push your work in this repository. Please free to edit this README.md file as per your requirements.

> **Scope (as per assignment brief):**
> This repository contains a complete implementation for WeightedKNN + XGBoost ensemble model for MNIST dataset classification, as well as a report explaining and showing observations as well as tuning efforts made by me.

---

**Important Note:** 
1. TAs will evaluate using the `.py` file only.
2. All your reports, plots, visualizations, etc pertaining to your solution should be uploaded to this GitHub repository

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

I have added the following files:
1) algorithms.py: contains the classes for the ML algorithms used for the ensemble model.
2) main.py: contains code for the main ensemble model.
3) ML_Lab_endsem_report_DA24B049.pdf report.

## 📦 Installation & Dependencies

Only numpy, pandas and time libraries are required to be installed.
---

## ▶️ Running the Code

All experiments should be runnable from the command line **and** reproducible in the notebook.

### A. Command-line (recommended for grading)

Run the main.py file after installing all libraries mentioned in the same folder as algorithms.py. For testing the ensemble model, check the comment in main.py file where you should change the x_val dataset location to the location of your test dataset.

## Best Practices:
* Keep commits with meaningful messages.
* Please do not write all code on your local machine and push everything to GitHub on the last day. The commits in GitHub should reflect how the code has evolved during the course of the assignment.
* Collaborations and discussions with other students is strictly prohibited.
* Code should be modularized and well-commented.
